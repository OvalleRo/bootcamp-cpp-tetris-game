# A simple TETRIS game implementation.

This implementation of the clasical TETRIS game was originally written for Globant's C++ Bootcamp (June - July of 2017).

The game is written in C++, acording to the specification document given at the start of the assignment. A rough design of the game is also available (both documents on the ./docs/ folder).

The master branch always compiles. A compiled version can be found in tetris.zip
